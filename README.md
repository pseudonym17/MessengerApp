# Overview

My purpose in creating this app was to gain more experience in mobile app development. I wanted to learn how to send messages between user, how to use recyler views, handlers, and many other features of Android Studio. I wanted to gain more experience in Firebase as well. I wanted to challenge myself by using different methods of displaying data in Android Studio.

This is a simple messenger app. The app is simple for a user to understand. You start by signing up or logging in, if you have already signed up. Then the user is brought to their contact page. On this page a user can add a contact if that contact is a registered user of the app. Then the user can click on any of their contacts to be brought to the chat page. Any previous messages will be displayed with their contact's messages on the left side of the screen, and the user's messages on the right side. The user can here type and send new messages to their contact. Their contact will be able to view these messages very quickly after the other user sends it.

My purpose for choosing a messenger app was that I eventually will add security to this app. This will ensure that only the intended party will be able to access messages sent to them. Before I can create a secure messenger app, I needed to learn how to send messages between users and gain more experience in Android Studio and Kotlin.
